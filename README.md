# HW3 - Lattice Linear Predicate Algorithm

The goal of this assignment is to implement a parallel LLP algorithm and apply it to hosts of problems. For this assignment, you can work in groups of two. You should submit the name of your partner in the
submitted assignment. All the teams must initially agree on the input and the output format. Each team will create two input cases for each of the problem.

You will submit the source code for your assignment along with the runtimes for each of the problems.

1. (100 points) Implement a library in Java that allows one to use LLP parallel algorithm to solve a problem.

You would need to design the API for the library such that it is easy to use the LLP algorithm for various problems. Apply your library to solve the following problems:

Teams 7,8,9 and 10

(a) Computing transitive closure of a directed graph
(b) Topological Sort of an Acyclic Directed Graph
(c) Boruvkaâ€™s Algorithm
(d) List-Ranking Problem
